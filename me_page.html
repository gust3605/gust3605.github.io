		<h2>How the website was created.</h2>
		<p>
		This website was created using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. HTML is what makes up the bones of each 
		page. It has the ability to set up tables, create headers, receive input, divide up the page, and 
		display text. CSS, or cascading style-sheet, is what decorates and formats a webiste. Using CSS, I was
		able to choose the colors for each page, select borders, and create and position things such as the 
		navigation menu. The JavaScript in the website is what allowed me to make things such as the dynamic table for the "To-Do List" page.
		An example of how I did this was by using buttons that were linked to EventListeners that, when triggered, would perform actions such as sorting the list or adding to it.
